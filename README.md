### **Music Storage System on Oracle Database**

This project is a database designed for storing and managing music-related data. Key features include:  

- Implementation in Oracle Database with access restricted to stored procedures.  
- Data import and export in JSON format.  
- Performance testing on a table with over 100,000 rows, including structure optimization and query plan analysis.  
- Use of Oracle technologies such as `DBMS_CRYPTO`, `UTL_FILE`, and full-text search.  
- Password hashing for secure user authentication.  

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable and high-performance database with secure access and support for large data volumes.
